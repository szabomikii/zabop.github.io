<p><strong>Reasons I find the Christmas message disgraceful</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week I have participated in a Carol service in STAG. It made me thinking about the true meaning of Christmas, or what people think the true meaning of Christmas is. I reckon some christians think that the true meaning of it has been diverted by modern society: the birth of Jesus is not in the centre anymore except in religious communities. There are some aspects of the mainstream non-religious interpretation of Christmas which I do not like, but I find the religious approach way more unsettling, so I will focus on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christianity celebrates the birth of Jesus. Why is it so important? Because he will die and resurrect, taking away the sins of those who believe in him. His father sent him to us, for our redemption. Isn&rsquo;t this awesome? God loved the world so much that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. Greatness. How loving this father must be? He loves us so much, fallible human beings, to send his only son to redeem us from the sins we have committed, and for the sins we are going to commit? If this story is true, this is the only thing that matters in life: to devote ourselves to this heavenly father. Nothing can be compared to his glory, and nothing is more important to make him pleased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except if he isn&rsquo;t. What if he isn&rsquo;t that great afterall. Let&rsquo;s go through this again: he had to send his son, to save us. Old folks, adults, children. Children too. Those newborns, who were born in sin. If we accept the story of Christmas, we have to accept that children, who cannot even speak, are born in sin, ie. they are sinful. That they need redemption to go to heaven. I think this idea, supposing that newborns are sinful, is disgusting. The idea has much in common with racism: the state of a newborn determines her destiny, just like the color of a newborn used to determine her life and death, until slavery was finally abolished. (Actually the Bible supports it, this might be a reason that it take us so long to figure out that slavery is a wrong thing and should be abolished, but that&rsquo;s another story.) A long story cut short: I do not want to believe that newborns are sinful. But if they are not, and the story about heaven and hell is true, they should be killed asap. This way, they surely go to heaven. If we let them grow up, some of them might not leave christianity, and lose her entry ticket to heaven. The surest way to prevent it is killing them, but God does not, and me neither, support the genocide of babies. Or, to be honest, God actually doesn&rsquo;t have problems with this occasionally, look at Noah or the children slaughtered during Herod&rsquo;s reign around Jesus&rsquo; birth. But mostly God doesn&rsquo;t like this stuff, so we have to keep them alive, which sucks, given that, statistically, some of them will go straight to hell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But okay, let&rsquo;s not care about that, we are accept the story, heaven and hell, not at all childish morality, that what&rsquo;s going on, keep calm. Next bit: we can go to heaven, because the middle eastern guy died 2000 years ago. I do not see the connection. Punishing him instead of us? How are the two things connected? So could I have been killed instead of Saddam Hussein, if I apply for it? Would it be just? So how the hell, oh, speaking of hell again, nvm, can it be just to kill a jewish bloke, for my sins?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But okay, let&rsquo;s accept that as well, this bloke dies for my sins, so I don&rsquo;t have to go to hell. I also have to believe this, for some reason, which doesn&rsquo;t make much sense either, if it is done, as the bloke said on the cross, then why do I have to believe it too? It is not done then yet, for some reason? Btw I am pretty sorry for the guy, I cannot imagine how people were so cruel to crucify someone. They must have had a horrible life to do this for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this Jesus guy didn&rsquo;t come down to sort out stuff, I would have had go to hell. For punishment. Yep, ya heard that right. Punishment after death. I believe that justice system is to make people better, to give them a next chance. So the concept of punishment in itself is something I reject. Yes, I do think that there are people who cannot come back to society, because they have done something so unforgivable. Although if I were a leader and I did not have to care about taxpayers money and deterrence, as God does not have to, I would make sure that these serial killers have good life conditions. The contrary would make them unnecessarily suffer. I see a point in suffering if this makes folks better. If it helps them to achieve, if it helps them to come back to society. But if we are talking about people who will not ever come back, then what is the reason for not providing them a good life if we can? Do we want to take revenge for their actions? Even if it is genocide, mass rape, war crime: revenge is not justified. It does not make anything better. It just created more suffering unnecessarily, so we have to condemn this behaviour. By the way, God is doing something similar, but worse: those who will not ever get to enjoy his presence are put in a place where they suffer. Just like Stalin&rsquo;s gulags, but much worse. Oh, and one more thing: you cannot die, it goes on forever. Punishment in itself is unjust, if it has no goal to make the person or society better. Eternal punishment is much worse though, it is my worst conceivable pointless unjustness I can think of. And if christians are right, God is doing it. That&rsquo;s why we need Christmas, to get this guy born, who will save us from this eternal suffering. Because God so loved the world, that those tiny portion of folks who believe in the son of an alleged virgin in ancient palestine, may not suffer from his unreasonableness, eternally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, this all might be right. We have no basis to think that something is wrong just because it is ridiculous. We have to look at the evidence, and if the story is not working, we can be sure, that this thing is not one we have to worry about. I would just pick one piece to demonstrate that this is fake, we can find loads of it, but this can work. So, the bloke is supposed to born in Bethlehem, otherwise he is not the right guy, according to the prophecy. There is no evidence that this census ever happened under the rule of Herod: there was one under Quirinius, but this was after Herod&rsquo;s reign, so the story falls apart right in the beginning. Another thing: folks did not have to go back where they were born for Roman censuses, so this part doesn&rsquo;t work neither. The lack of evidence, the problems with the story in the Bible is so obvious, that I believe people mostly do not see it because they do not want to see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to Christmas: I do not want to celebrate human sacrifice. This is what religion is doing: to replace the scapegoat, used by ancient tribes with a human being. This is just disgraceful. To use someone&rsquo;s death to take away the sins of others? Incas sacrificed children, and we are terrified of it, and we do not seem to be able to grasp how people could be so stupid to kill their own children. Let&rsquo;s not use double standards: if a 2000 years old story with multiple flaws promotes human sacrifice, we are morally obligated to condemn it. There is no other way around it. Child sacrifice is immoral. Human sacrifice is immoral. The religious approach to christmas is immoral.</span></p>
